**TVS_Epic_IT_Challenge**

This project was made in collaboration with @HarshGupta02 (https://github.com/HarshGupta02) for tvs_it_challenge hackathon

In this we were suppsed to automate the entire evaluation process of used automobiles such that no human intervention would be required in between.
For that we devided our project into client side and server side.

*Client Side*
This is basically the frontend of our website where client/user will enter all the information regarding his vehicle like Brand,Year,Model_name,Ownershipn and Location and then to make the evaluation even better we asked users to enter their vehicle's accelerating and deaccelerating sounds and its 4 sided view for audio and image comparison as well

*Server Side*
This is where all the comparisons are done in the backendand and score generated will be shown in the fronted. It heppens in few stpes:
->firstly an inital sore is calculated all the user input apart form the audio and pics using a valuation equation
